# About Dataset

## Context

This dataset is used for Face Mask Detection Classification with images. The dataset consists of almost 12K images which are almost 328.92MB in size.

## Acknowledgments

All the images with the face mask (~6K) are scrapped from Google search and all the images without the face mask are preprocessed from the CelebFace dataset created by Jessica Li ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530))

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind creating this dataset is to create an algorithm that can directly detect if a person is wearing a face mask or not. images scrapped from Google as well as from the CelebFace dataset.
